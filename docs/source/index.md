Welcome to openMTPK's documentation.
===================================
**openMTPK** is an open-source, multi-threaded, and general purpose mathematics package written in C++ with
a primary focus on Numbery Theory and Cryptographic algorithms, Linear Algebra, and Machine/Deep learning concepts
as well as a range of language API's. openMTPK aims to provide options for pre-built functions, models, etc.
along with modularity for user freedom.
Look in the [samples](https://github.com/akielaries/openMTPK/tree/main/samples) folder for examples
on how to use some of openMTPK's functionalities.

This documentation highlights how to use the source C++ library as well as the 
Python API generated with the help of SWIG. 

The published PyPI package for openMTPK can be 
seen [here](https://pypi.org/project/openmtpk/).
