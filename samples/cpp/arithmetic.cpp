     * This functionality was really only implemented for practice
     * for dealing with complex algorithms and equations later. There
     * a plethora of ways to store data and then perform basic
     * arithmetic operations so it is trivial to reinvent the wheel
     * for these types of operations. Ideally if you want to perform
     * the summation or product on a list type structure of numbers
     * you may want to implement it on your own, this implementation
     * is just for fun :)
     *
     * steps to perform arithmetic operations:
     * 1. declare arith object (see RM_arith.hpp)
     * 2. declare some variables initializing to values
     * 3. using the declared arith object call the operations,
     * rm_add, rm_sub, rm_mult
     * 4. print out the values if you want or manipulate them further
