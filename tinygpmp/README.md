# tinygpmp
`tinygpmp` aims to support low-voltage and resource constrained devices,
primarily microcontrollers. For now, focus on support for AVR and STM32
series devices is planned.

## Testing
The `fixture` directory contains instructions and source code for an example application
and debugging via the UART pins on an STM32 and monitoring this connection using
screen or minicom on the `/dev`
