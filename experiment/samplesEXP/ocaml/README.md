# The OCaml API is currently on hold
The existing efforts make use of the SWIG wrapper generation
tool for creating the interface. Since SWIG states OCaml wrapper
generation is in experimentation, this process is not entirely 
intuitive or working. Perhaps other methods should be explored if 
openMTPK is to be used for OCaml.
