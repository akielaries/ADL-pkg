# v0.10.0
## What's Changed 
* Documentation layout + additions
* `mtpk::core::ThreadPool()` class capable of spawning a specific number of threads or
the default `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`.
    * view docs [here](https://akielaries.github.io/openMTPK/classmtpk_1_1ThreadPool.html)
    > **Note** This class is not yet used innately within openMTPK and is provided as a user utility for now.

* `mtpk::core::ThreadDispatch()` class that dispatches functions to the threadpool. 
    * view docs [here](https://akielaries.github.io/openMTPK/classmtpk_1_1ThreadDispatch.html)
* `mtpk::core::DataTable()` class capable of reading in CSV files storing them as a pair of 
vector strings. For now, the DataTable class features very limited functionality, reading in CSVs(entirely,
or specific columns), formatted displaying, and two conversion methods for the `string->int` & `string->double`.
    * Solves open enhancement [`#29 DataFrame/DataTable related functionality`](https://github.com/akielaries/openMTPK/issues/29)
    * view docs [here](https://akielaries.github.io/openMTPK/classmtpk_1_1core_1_1DataTable.html)
* Created [`rolling`](https://github.com/akielaries/openMTPK/tree/rolling) branch that will update its commits 
from the [mtpk-bot](https://github.com/mtpk-bot) user on a nightly basis, using the `#NIGHTLY:` commit message 
prefix.
* Introduced updates to calculus module in numerical differentation methods. First, second, and third order derivatives methods 
of a given polynomial in a function at a given value. For example f(x) = x^2ln(x) = `x*x*log(x)`.
* Updates to unit tests and additions for the new classes introduced.
* Updates to namespaces, the core module containing the ThreadPool and DataTable related methods along with other miscellaneous
tools lies under the `mtpk::core` namespace. 
* Patches introduced for [`#27 OSX Build reaches dead state`](https://github.com/akielaries/openMTPK/issues/27)
* TODO


# v0.9.4

   * `clang-format` for linting/formatting C++ source code, `autopep8` for Python.
   * Python PyPI packaging edits.
   * Tag bump related commits will include a `#MAJOR`, `#MINOR`, or `#PATCH` prefix to the commit message.
   * Updates to certain directories run certain jobs.
* Continuous Machine Learning & Linear Algebra module updates. 
   * Stubbed out implementations for activation, regularization, optimization & model trainer methods, statistical helpers, random sorts + utilities. 
   * `Matrix` related methods are usable. More updates to come.
   * ML module is not currently usable aside from `Linear Regression` model on very select data sets.

# v0.6.0
## New Changes in v0.6.0
1. Continued changes to Linear Algebra Module + samples
2. Continued updates to Python API, injecting new C++ source functionalities into the `setup.py` file used in packaging process for PyPI
	* Install with `pip install openmtpk==0.6.1`
3. Updates to the `mtpk` namespace. Wrapped more classes in the namespace, does not affect Python API
4. Changes/updates to datatypes to allow for maximum precision while also avoiding potential overflow as well as for conciseness
	> **Note** Some int and char types will be updated later on to ensure nothing breaks
	* `int`----------->`int64_t`
	* `long long`-->`int64_t`
	* `unsigned`---->`uint64_t`
	* `double`------->`long double`
	* `float`--------->`long double`
5. Adding `make uninstall` option for the project's build process with CMake. See the install/uninstall directions [here](https://github.com/akielaries/openMTPK#installation).


# v0.5.3
## What's Changed 
1. Updates to Linear Algebra Module and samples
	* See this [example](https://github.com/akielaries/openMTPK/blob/main/samples/cpp/linalg_ops.cpp) to view operations on matrices
	* More updates to samples as development continues
2. PyPI updates
	* Adjusting SWIG process to accommodate for template based classes and methods
	* openmtpk `0.5.14` release [here](https://pypi.org/project/openmtpk/0.5.13/)
